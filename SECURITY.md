# Security

If you find a significant vulnerability, or evidence of one,
please report it privately.

We prefer that you use the [GitHub mechanism for privately reporting a vulnerability][security docs url]. Under the
[main repository's security tab][security url], click "Report a vulnerability" to open the advisory form.
